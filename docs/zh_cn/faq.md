- **Unable to install xtcocotools**

  1. Try to install it using pypi manually `pip install xtcocotools`.
  2. If step1 does not work. Try to install it from [source](https://github.com/jin-s13/xtcocoapi).

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/jin-s13/xtcocoapi
  cd xtcocoapi
  python setup.py install
  ```

- **No matching distribution found for xtcocotools>=1.6**

  1. Install cython by `pip install cython`.
  2. Install xtcocotools from [source](https://github.com/jin-s13/xtcocoapi).

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/jin-s13/xtcocoapi
  cd xtcocoapi
  python setup.py install
  ```

- **"No module named 'mmcv.ops'"; "No module named 'mmcv.\_ext'"**

  1. Uninstall existing mmcv in the environment using `pip uninstall mmcv`.
  2. Install mmcv-full following the [installation instruction](https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation).

## Data

- **What if my custom dataset does not have bounding box label?**

  We can estimate the bounding box of a person as the minimal box that tightly bounds all the keypoints.

- **What is `COCO_val2017_detections_AP_H_56_person.json`? Can I train pose models without it?**

  "COCO_val2017_detections_AP_H_56_person.json" contains the "detected" human bounding boxes for COCO validation set, which are generated by FasterRCNN.
  One can choose to use gt bounding boxes to evaluate models, by setting `bbox_file=None''` in `val_dataloader.dataset` in config. Or one can use detected boxes to evaluate
  the generalizability of models, by setting `bbox_file='COCO_val2017_detections_AP_H_56_person.json'`.

## Training

- **RuntimeError: Address already in use**

  Set the environment variables `MASTER_PORT=XXX`. For example,
  `MASTER_PORT=29517 GPUS=16 GPUS_PER_NODE=8 CPUS_PER_TASK=2 ./tools/slurm_train.sh Test res50 configs/body_2d_keypoint/topdown_regression/coco/td-reg_res50_8xb64-210e_coco-256x192.py work_dirs/res50_coco_256x192`

- **"Unexpected keys in source state dict" when loading pre-trained weights**

  It's normal that some layers in the pretrained model are not used in the pose model. ImageNet-pretrained classification network and the pose network may have different architectures (e.g. no classification head). So some unexpected keys in source state dict is actually expected.

- **How to use trained models for backbone pre-training ?**

  Refer to [Migration - Step3: Model - Backbone](../migration.md).

  When training, the unexpected keys will be ignored.

- **How to visualize the training accuracy/loss curves in real-time ?**

  Use `TensorboardLoggerHook` in `log_config` like

  ```python
  log_config=dict(interval=20, hooks=[dict(type='TensorboardLoggerHook')])
  ```

  You can refer to [user_guides/visualization.md](../user_guides/visualization.md).

- **Log info is NOT printed**

  Use smaller log interval. For example, change `interval=50` to `interval=1` in the config.

## Evaluation

- **How to evaluate on MPII test dataset?**
  Since we do not have the ground-truth for test dataset, we cannot evaluate it 'locally'.
  If you would like to evaluate the performance on test set, you have to upload the pred.mat (which is generated during testing) to the official server via email, according to [the MPII guideline](http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/#evaluation).

- **For top-down 2d pose estimation, why predicted joint coordinates can be out of the bounding box (bbox)?**
  We do not directly use the bbox to crop the image. bbox will be first transformed to center & scale, and the scale will be multiplied by a factor (1.25) to include some context. If the ratio of width/height is different from that of model input (possibly 192/256), we will adjust the bbox.

## Inference

- **How to run mmpose on CPU?**

  Run demos with `--device=cpu`.

- **How to speed up inference?**

  For top-down models, try to edit the config file. For example,

  1. set `flip_test=False` in `init_cfg` in the config file.
  2. use faster human bounding box detector, see [MMDetection](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/3.x/model_zoo.html).

- **What is the definition of each keypoint index?**

  Check the [meta information file](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/tree/main/configs/_base_/datasets) for the dataset used to train the model you are using. They key `keypoint_info` includes the definition of each keypoint.
