## Data

- **What if my custom dataset does not have bounding box label?**

  We can estimate the bounding box of a person as the minimal box that tightly bounds all the keypoints.

- **What if my custom dataset does not have segmentation label?**

  Just set the `area` of the person as the area of the bounding boxes. During evaluation, please set `use_area=False` as in this [example](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/blob/a82dd486853a8a471522ac06b8b9356db61f8547/mmpose/datasets/datasets/top_down/topdown_aic_dataset.py#L113).

- **What is `COCO_val2017_detections_AP_H_56_person.json`? Can I train pose models without it?**

  "COCO_val2017_detections_AP_H_56_person.json" contains the "detected" human bounding boxes for COCO validation set, which are generated by FasterRCNN.
  One can choose to use gt bounding boxes to evaluate models, by setting `use_gt_bbox=True` and `bbox_file=''`. Or one can use detected boxes to evaluate
  the generalizability of models, by setting `use_gt_bbox=False` and `bbox_file='COCO_val2017_detections_AP_H_56_person.json'`.

## Training

- **RuntimeError: Address already in use**

  Set the environment variables `MASTER_PORT=XXX`. For example,
  `MASTER_PORT=29517 GPUS=16 GPUS_PER_NODE=8 CPUS_PER_TASK=2 ./tools/slurm_train.sh Test res50 configs/top_down/resnet/coco/res50_coco_256x192.py work_dirs/res50_coco_256x192`

- **"Unexpected keys in source state dict" when loading pre-trained weights**

  It's normal that some layers in the pretrained model are not used in the pose model. ImageNet-pretrained classification network and the pose network may have different architectures (e.g. no classification head). So some unexpected keys in source state dict is actually expected.

- **How to use trained models for backbone pre-training ?**

  Refer to [Use Pre-Trained Model](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/blob/master/docs/tutorials/1_finetune.md#use-pre-trained-model),
  in order to use the pre-trained model for the whole network (backbone + head), the new config adds the link of pre-trained models in the `load_from`.

  And to use backbone for pre-training, you can change `pretrained` value in the backbone dict of config files to the checkpoint path / url.
  When training, the unexpected keys will be ignored.

- **How to visualize the training accuracy/loss curves in real-time ?**

  Use `TensorboardLoggerHook` in `log_config` like

  ```python
  log_config=dict(interval=20, hooks=[dict(type='TensorboardLoggerHook')])
  ```

  You can refer to [tutorials/6_customize_runtime.md](/tutorials/6_customize_runtime.md#log-config) and the example [config](/configs/top_down/resnet/coco/res50_coco_256x192.py#L26).

- **Log info is NOT printed**

  Use smaller log interval. For example, change `interval=50` to `interval=1` in the [config](/configs/top_down/resnet/coco/res50_coco_256x192.py#L23).

- **How to fix stages of backbone when finetuning a model ?**

    You can refer to [`def _freeze_stages()`](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/blob/d026725554f9dc08e8708bd9da8678f794a7c9a6/mmpose/models/backbones/resnet.py#L618) and [`frozen_stages`](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/blob/d026725554f9dc08e8708bd9da8678f794a7c9a6/mmpose/models/backbones/resnet.py#L498),
    reminding to set `find_unused_parameters = True` in config files for distributed training or testing.

## Evaluation

- **How to evaluate on MPII test dataset?**
  Since we do not have the ground-truth for test dataset, we cannot evalute it 'locally'.
  If you would like to evaluate the performance on test set, you have to upload the pred.mat (which is generated during testing) to the official server via email, according to [the MPII guideline](http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/#evaluation).

## Inference

- **How to run mmpose on CPU?**

  Run demos with `--device=cpu`.

- **How to speed up inference?**

  For top-down models, try to edit the config file. For example,

  1. set `flip_test=False` in [topdown-res50](/configs/top_down/resnet/coco/res50_coco_256x192.py#L51).
  1. set `post_process='default'` in [topdown-res50](/configs/top_down/resnet/coco/res50_coco_256x192.py#L54).
  1. use faster human bounding box detector, see [MMDetection](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_zoo.html).

  For bottom-up models, try to edit the config file. For example,

  1. set `flip_test=False` in [bottomup-res50](/configs/bottom_up/resnet/coco/res50_coco_512x512.py#L80).
  1. set `adjust=False` in [bottomup-res50](/configs/bottom_up/resnet/coco/res50_coco_512x512.py#L78).
  1. set `refine=False` in [bottomup-res50](/configs/bottom_up/resnet/coco/res50_coco_512x512.py#L79).
  1. use smaller input image size in [bottomup-res50](/configs/bottom_up/resnet/coco/res50_coco_512x512.py#L39).

## Deployment

- **Why is the onnx model converted by mmpose throwing error when converting to other frameworks such as TensorRT?**

    For now, we can only make sure that models in mmpose are onnx-compatible. However, some operations in onnx may be unsupported by your target framework for deployment, e.g. TensorRT in [this issue](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/issues/414). When such situation occurs, we suggest you raise an issue and ask the community to help as long as `pytorch2onnx.py` works well and is verified numerically.
